## Technologies Used

- **.NET 9 / .NET 8 / .NET 6** (update as per your target)
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Microsoft Identity**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- **xUnit** (unit testing)
- **Moq** (mocking for tests)
- **Swagger** (OpenAPI UI)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or change connection string for your DB)
- (Optional) Visual Studio or VS Code

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd GraduationProject
   ```

2. **Configure the database and JWT:**
   - Edit `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=GraduationProjectDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     },
     "JWT": {
       "Key": "YourSuperSecretKeyHere",
       "Issuer": "YourIssuer",
       "Audience": "YourAudience"
     }
     ```

### Database Migration

1. **Apply migrations and create the database:**
   ```sh
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

   > If you need to create a migration:
   > ```sh
   > dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   > ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the API:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
2. **Open Swagger UI:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger` (or the port shown in your console).

## API Endpoints

### Doctor Endpoints

| Method | Route                      | Description                | Auth Required |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| GET    | `/api/Doctor/GetAllDoctor` | List all doctors           | No           |
| POST   | `/api/Doctor/AddDoctor`    | Add a new doctor           | Yes          |
| PUT    | `/api/Doctor/UpdateDoctor` | Update doctor by ID        | Yes          |
| DELETE | `/api/Doctor/DeleteDoctor` | Delete doctor by ID        | Yes          |

### User Endpoints

| Method | Route                      | Description                | Auth Required |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| POST   | `/api/User/register`       | Register a new user        | No           |
| POST   | `/api/User/login`          | Login and get JWT token    | No           |
| DELETE | `/api/User/delete-User`    | Delete user by email       | Yes          |

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Bearer Authentication** is used.
- After login, include the returned token in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
  ```

---

## Unit Testing

- All core services are covered by unit tests using **xUnit** and **Moq**.
- To run tests:
  ```sh
  cd GraduationProject.Tests
  dotnet test
  ```
- Test files:
  - `DoctorServicesTests.cs`
  - `AuthServicesTests.cs`
  - `TokenServicesTests.cs`

---

## Extending the Project

- **Add new models** in `Models/` and update `ApplicationDb`.
- **Add new endpoints** in `Controllers/`.
- **Add new services** in `Services/` and register them in `Program.cs`.
- **Add new tests** in `GraduationProject.Tests/`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Database errors:** Check your connection string and ensure SQL Server is running.
- **JWT errors:** Ensure your `JWT:Key`, `Issuer`, and `Audience` are set and match in both appsettings and your client.
- **Tests not running:** Ensure all NuGet packages are restored (`dotnet restore`), and you are in the correct directory.
